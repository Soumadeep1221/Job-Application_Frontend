# Job Application Management System — Frontend

A React-based client application for the **Job Application Management System**, built with a clean and minimal interface to demonstrate how a frontend communicates with a SpringBoot REST API.

👉 **Backend Repository:**
[https://github.com/Soumadeep1221/Job-Application_Backend](https://github.com/Soumadeep1221/Job-Application_Backend)

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains the frontend of the Job Application Management System where users can:

* View job posts
* Create new listings
* Update existing jobs
* Delete job posts
* Search jobs by:

  * Job title
  * Description

The primary goal of this frontend is to clearly showcase **frontend-backend integration** rather than complex UI design.

---

## 🎨 UI Note

The user interface is intentionally kept **simple and minimal** so that the focus remains on understanding:

* How React interacts with REST APIs
* How data flows between client and server
* How CRUD operations function in a full-stack environment

This project prioritizes functionality and architecture over advanced styling.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **ReactJS** — Component-based UI
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** — Application logic
* **REST API Integration** — Communication with Spring Boot backend

---

## 🧠 Architecture

This project follows a decoupled full-stack architecture:

Frontend (React) → REST API → Spring Boot → PostgreSQL

Benefits include:

* Better scalability
* Independent development
* Easier maintenance

---

## 📌 Project Evolution

This application is an **upgraded version** of an earlier system that used:

* JSP for frontend
* No dedicated database

### Improvements

✅ Migrated to React
✅ Introduced PostgreSQL
✅ Adopted a separated frontend-backend architecture

---

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
